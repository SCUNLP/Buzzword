        "meaning": "A \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\" Moment is a moment of time when one individual is bored to the point they type all the letters on the keyboard in certain patterns, and proceed to see the definitions of each pattern on the website known as \"Urban Dictionary.\"\nThe first instance of this occurring is when the most common keyboard pattern \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\" (Hence the Name) first appeared on Urban Dictionary, and the word was defined as; \"A phenomena that happens to a computer's keyboard when a human being is bored to death...\" This led to many other people creating patterns on their keyboards, such as, \"qazwsxedcrfvtgbyhnujmikolp,\" \"mnbvcxzlkjhgfdsapoiuytrewq,\" and \"plmoknijbuhvygctfxrdzeswaq,\" which were all defined with similar definitions, with one thing being in common; boredom. Thus, these instances still occur with more people trying to form new and unique keyboard patterns in a battle to see who defines them first on Urban Dictionary. These moments, forged from the human emotion of \"boredom,\" mixed with the accessibility to a device with a keyboard, have now been defined as, A \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\" Moment, a time where a bored person proceeds to type all of the keys on a keyboard in a certain pattern, in hopes that their boredom will disappear, and also in hopes of finding the pattern they typed on Urban Dictionary.",
